# Experimental App for Railsgirls Hamburg

Railsgirls Hamburg Website: http://www.railsgirls.com/hamburg

This app is experimental. It might replace our current website and/or become the tool for planning our railsgirls events one day. 

It is using the rails engine [Learnery](https://github.com/learnery/learnery) and is base on its example app [learnery-railsgirls](https://github.com/learnery/learnery-railsgirls).

The branch 'upstream' is meant to stay in sync with the example app so that we can easily integrate updates from there.
